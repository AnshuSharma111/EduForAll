# **EduForAll**

EduForAll is the all-in-one solution for students in need of resources for their education. A website that any one can use to gain knowledge on any topic.

Just search for a topic you want to learn and get:
1) Links to relevant websites
2) PDF files
3) Summarisation of the topic by AI tools
4) Relevant Videos
and much more

This is achieved via scraping the web for relevant resources. A few websites are scraped and their content is summarised using a LLM for the summary section.
Relevant sites are obtained by using Selenium Google API. PDF files are obtained by using Project Gutenburg and relevant videos are embedded into the site from 
YouTube.
